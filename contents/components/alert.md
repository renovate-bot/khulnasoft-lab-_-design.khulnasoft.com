## Guidelines

### When to use

- Advise a user about a system-generated event or condition related to their current context needing attention.
- Reaffirm to a user that a prior action has been successful. Typically background or async actions initiated in a different location or context.
- Present a dynamic status update based on system conditions or user actions.
- In combination with form validation to help users remedy errors. See the [accessibility](#accessibility) section for more.

### When not to use

- If you need to deliver an instance level message from an admin to all users, use a [broadcast message](/components/broadcast-message) instead.
- If you are immediately confirming a user's action while they remain in the same view, use a [toast](/components/toast) instead.
- If you are promoting, soliciting feedback, or informing a user about a feature, use a [banner](/components/banner) instead.
- If you need to display static documentation, warnings, or contextual information that's always present, use [contextual help and info](usability/contextual-help) patterns instead. These can be styled using [feedback and status](product-foundations/design-tokens-using#choosing-between-feedback-and-status) utility classes. Alerts include focus management and semantic ARIA roles that are intended for dynamic notifications, not static content.

### Variants

- **Danger**: Advise the user that their attention is needed to address or be aware of a critical issue that relates to the current context.
- **Warning**: Caution the user that their attention or action may be needed within the current context, but it may not be critical.
- **Success**: Reaffirm to the user that a prior action they have taken, often in a different location within the application, has been successful.
- **Information**: Provide supplemental information to the user in regards to the current context or action they are about to take.
- **Tip**: Educate the user about new or unused features, and other useful information.

### Behavior

- Permanently dismissible only when the alert relates to a user's individual instance and wasn't triggered by a system condition.
- Permanently dismissible when a task isn't blocked or if no action is required.
- A dismissed alert can reappear if an action or system event reproduces it.

### Content

- All copy within an alert should be short, actionable, and use clear language.
- Keep translations in mind when writing copy and follow [UI text](/content/ui-text) guidelines.

#### Title

- Be brief and keep it to a single line by using a sentence fragment.
- Avoid punctuation, like periods, commas, or semicolons.

#### Message

- Provide next steps, troubleshooting actions, or links to learn about or remedy the event that triggered the alert.
- Avoid paraphrasing the title if one is included.
- Write as if the title was the first sentence of the message.
- Keep to one or two sentences when possible.
- Use sentence case and appropriate punctuation based on our [punctuation guidelines](/content/punctuation).

#### Actions

- Up to two actions can be used at a time.
- Primary action uses the **confirm** button variant.
- Secondary action uses the **default** button variant.
- Left aligned, except in right-to-left languages where they are right aligned and the order is the same. See button [alignment](/components/button#alignment) and [order](/components/button#order) for more details.

### Placement

- **Global**: Impacts the entire experience, is always full-width, and is placed directly below the breadcrumb bar.
  <figure-img alt="Global alert position" label="Full-width danger alert" src="/img/alert-global.svg" width="332"></figure-img>
- **Page-level**: Appears near the top of a page, directly above a header section, and is restricted to the content container width, which can be either fixed or fluid, depending on a user’s preference.
  <figure-img alt="Page-level alert position" label="Page-level danger alert in the main content area with space above and below" src="/img/alert-page-level.svg" width="332"></figure-img>
- **In-page**: Within a section of the page when the message is specific to that content.
  <figure-img alt="In-page alert position" label="In-page danger alert contextually placed with space above and below" src="/img/alert-in-page.svg" width="332"></figure-img>

#### Sticky positioning

- Uses `position: sticky` to keep critical information in view as the page scrolls.
- Helpful when an alert is added without a page refresh and its position would otherwise be out of view.
- Usually is reserved for errors, as they need to be addressed by users.
- Only one sticky alert should be used at a time.

#### Multiple alerts

- Multiple alerts should be avoided if at all possible, but if necessary ensure the placement of each is in the same context as the content it relates to.
- When multiple alerts are present in the same location, order them from most to least severe.

### Accessibility

- An alert should receive focus and use `aria-live` to announce its presence and allow a user to interact with it immediately.
- If sticky positioning is used, the user must still be able to access and view focusable elements the alert may be covering.
- An alert is separate from, but complimentary to [validation](/patterns/forms#validation) error messages. In this way an alert announces that there are validation errors and links a user to each instance.
